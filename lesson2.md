# Lesson 2

## Importing library's
Some times you want to code somthing but \
you need access to the internet \
and coding a internet libray is a bitch and a half \
the good news is that some sad chap already coded it. every install \
after 3.4 comes with pip or pip install python. \
## How do we do this shit

in your command prompt type...
```bash
dev@localhost:~$ pip3 -V
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)
```
