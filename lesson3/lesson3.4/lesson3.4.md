# Defining functions
We have been using functions like print() and input() well its about time we make our own.
Functions are blocks of code that only run when called; To **define** a function we use the `def` keyword \
The syntax of a function definition looks somrthinfg like this:
```python
def yo():       # Giving the function a name
    print("yo") # What the executes when called

yo()            # Calling the function
```
