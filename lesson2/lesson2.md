# Lesson 2

## Importing library's
Some times you want to code somthing but \
you need access to the internet \
and coding a internet libray is a bitch and a half \
the good news is that some sad chap already coded it. every install \
after 3.4 comes with pip or pip install python. 
## How do we do this

in your command prompt type...
```bash
dev@localhost:~$ pip3 -V
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)
```
### Installing a package
very simple. the syntax is as follows
```bash
pip3 [command] <package_name>
```

after that you can import a libray by adding this line \
to your python file
```python
import time
from os import system
```
